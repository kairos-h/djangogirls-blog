# djangogirls-blog (Sigani Jina)
A simple blog made with Django, following the Django Girls tutorial.

I want to add more features soon and change the layout and styling, making it grow into a somewhat more personal project while I learn more about Django.
I might just include the things taught in the extended tutorial and personalise the styling, though, if I decide to begin another project from scratch.

# Wanna try it?
If you're interested in learning Django, their tutorial is a great resource: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
There are translations to several other languages as well. Give it a try!
